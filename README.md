## Description

myworkspace is an easy-to-use app for keeping track of important information within your organization or place of work. 

**Key Features**

*Account Creation and Login* : When first visiting MWS, users are prompted to either login or create and account. If no account exists for a user, they can easily sign up by providing thier name, email address, and creating a password for future login.

*User Profile Page* : Each account has a dedicated profile page that displays the basic information about the user, the coworkers that are associated with the user, and projects with which the user is currently a member. 

*Projects* : One of the most important features of MWS is *Projects*. Users can create thier own projects or be added to/join projects created by other users. Projects are listed on the user's home page, and by clicking on a specific project the user will be taken to that project's dedicate page. Projects track the progess of your work. You can see coworkers that are also working on the project in the project's page. Additionally, individual tasks that are associated with the completion of the project are listed in the project page and can be edited.

*Tasks* : Tasks are like a checklist for the completion of a specific project. Users can create tasks in the project page. Tasks exist in three states: open, in progress, and completed. The status of a task can be updated as work is completed on those tasks.   

*Coworkers* : Coworkers are your collegues within your organization that you share a network with, primarily through projects and tasks. If you are assigned to the same project or task as another employee within your organization that uses myworkspace, that employee is automatically added to you coworker list.
